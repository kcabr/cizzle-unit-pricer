## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- PyYAML (optional, for better config file format - will fallback to JSON if not available)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd unit-cost-calculator
   ```

2. **Ensure Python is installed**

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://python.org)

3. **Install PyYAML (optional, for better config files)**

   ```bash
   pip install PyYAML
   ```

   If not installed, the app will use JSON format for config files instead.

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage

1. **Start a new session** and select product type (Dry or Liquid)
2. **Add products** by clicking "+ Add Product"
3. **Enter product details:**
   - Product name
   - Store
   - Price
   - Quantity and unit
   - Optional: Product URL for reference
4. **Click "Calculate & Compare"** to see results
5. **Save your session** using File → Save Session for later reference

### Session Files

- Sessions are saved as XML files that can be shared or backed up
- The application automatically loads your last session when started
- Auto-save keeps your work safe as you make changes

## Example Use Case

Compare breakfast cereal prices:

- Store A: $4.99 for 18 oz box
- Store B: $3.79 for 12 oz box
- Store C: $6.49 for 24 oz box

The calculator will show you the cost per ounce for each, helping you identify that Store C actually offers the best value despite the higher upfront cost.
